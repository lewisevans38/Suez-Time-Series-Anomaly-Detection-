# Suez-Time-Series-Anomaly-Detection-
This project includes the notebooks used to find the results and to plot the figures that are in the paper. 
The GRU notebook and the mode collapse notebook are auxilliary notebooks solely used for creating interesting figures and no credence is given to their results.

All the code for the LSTM-AE was based off the following tutorial https://curiousily.com/posts/time-series-anomaly-detection-using-lstm-autoencoder-with-pytorch-in-python/. 

The code for the TadGAN was based off of two main githubs
